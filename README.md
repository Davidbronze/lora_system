# lora_system
lora gateway, sender, endpoint and weather station
This is an amateur experience to install a system based on lora and wifi to control 4 relays that turn on irrigation sectors controlled from a web page.
Using Heltec ESP32 LoRa V2 board to control weather station and to send data to databank and an ESP01 (8266) to control relays.
Not ready to use. ThereÂ´s a lot of issues to solve.
